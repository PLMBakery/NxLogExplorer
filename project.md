# nxLogExplorer

## Project Overview
nxLogExplorer is a tool for analyzing NX log files in conjunction with Teamcenter. It extracts load times for components, error messages, and other key information from log files and exports this data into an Excel file for further analysis.

## Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly GUI to select and analyze log files.
- Extract load times and error messages from log files.
- Export analyzed data into an Excel file.
- Implement functions to filter and analyze the data within the application.
